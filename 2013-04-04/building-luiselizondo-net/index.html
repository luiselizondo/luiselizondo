<meta name="description" content="I wanted to have a blog for a very long time, and it was one of those things you always end up never doing. This is the story and what&#39;s behind this blog, most of what I&#39;m about to tell you is written for non-humans,&nbsp; so if you speak Drupal, please continue, if not, you can read any other of my blog posts... or read a book.After being a Drupal guy, but having problems specially with how Drupal handles Media, I decided to give Wordpress a chance, only to decide that there wasn&#39;t a better blog system than Tumblr. And it&#39;s great, but, eventually, you just wanto to move away from it. After much tought, I decided I wanted a Saas using Wordpress, so I started using Wordpress.org. It was awesome, Wordpress.org has made terrific progress since the last time I used it, but Saas it&#39;s not for everyone, specially when you can&#39;t install some Plugin / Module. So I decided to remove the site on Wordpress.org and move it to my @Linode server.But one day something broke up. And then, tired of trying, I ended up giving Drupal 7 another chance, specially since the Media module made some terrific progress in the last months. And here it is, my Blog running on Drupal 7. Not everything was easy, I had some problems with the Google Analytics module / verification process, I also had some problems with the Debut Features set. And finally, I had more trouble with the Apps module / ecosystem.When I solved all those problems, I also wanted to enable Twitter (to tweet everytime I create a new post) but I haven&#39;t been able to complete the process, I keep getting one error. I also wanted to create posts from my iPhone, so I downloaded DrupalGap, but after struggling for a couple of hours without any progress, I decided to give up. But the next day I disabled Global Redirect and everything worked like magic. Only to find out minutes later that the iOS app wasn&#39;t what I was expecting and I decided I have to do something about it. There&#39;s the &quot;Drupal Create&quot; iOS app but I haven&#39;t used it so I don&#39;t even know what it does, it might end up being not what I expect. Anyway, the site usines Twitter Bootstrap and I&#39;m also using the &quot;Elder&quot; theme as an admin theme, both are responsive so I can use iOS to create content when I&#39;m not on my computer.Finally, the site runs Nginx becuase I wanted to give it a try. Right know it&#39;s working great but I keep getting an error: &quot;Your server is not capable of displaying file upload progress. File upload progress requires an Apache server running PHP with mod_php.&quot;" />
